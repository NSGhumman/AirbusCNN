Apparently, I need to run this command before I can do anything meaningful with pip install.

sudo apt-get install python-dev  \
     build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev \
     libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev \
     python-pip

sudo apt-get python-tk

Python Dependencies:
	
	[1] keras
	[2] opencv-python
	[3] python 2.7.8
	[4] matplotlib
	[4] numpy


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:
	[1] Do sudo pip installs as opposed to local installs with --user. 
	    Why? Maybe has to do with access to slave computers.
	[2] OR you could do conda installs directly for the modules and ignore the apt-gets at the top.
